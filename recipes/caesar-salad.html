    <h2>No, not <em>that</em> Caesar.</h2>
    <p>Although the recipe has changed over time, the salad's creation is generally attributed to the restaurateur Caesar Cardini, an Italian immigrant who operated restaurants in Mexico and the United States. Cardini lived in San Diego but ran one of his restaurants in nearby border town Tijuana to attract American customers seeking to circumvent the restrictions of Prohibition. </p>
    <p>His daughter, Rosa, recounted that her father invented the salad at the Tijuana restaurant when a Fourth of July rush in 1924 depleted the kitchen's supplies. Cardini made do with what he had, adding the dramatic flair of table-side tossing by the chef.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Dressing Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium sized bowl, begin by whisking together the garlic, anchovy paste, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Next, whisk in the mayonnaise, Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt, and pepper. Taste and adjust to your liking. The dressing will keep well in the fridge for about a week.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Crouton Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350˚F. Cut the baguette in half lengthwise through the top of the baguette then slice diagonally into 1/4" thick pieces. Place the breads onto a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil and 1 tsp of finely minced garlic. Drizzle the garlic oil over the croutons and sprinkle the top with 2 Tbsp grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Toss until evenly coated. Spread in a single layer over the baking sheet and bake at 350˚F until light golden and crisp (10-12 minutes), or to desired crispness.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Caesar Salad Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse, dry and chop (or tear) the romaine lettuce into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>In a large serving bowl, toss the lettuce with enough dressing to lightly coat the leaves (or to your preference). You may not need all of the dressing.
        </li>
        <li>Add half of the croutons and thinly shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and toss again.
        </li>
        <li>Top with remaining croutons and cheese and serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
