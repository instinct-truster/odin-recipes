    <h2>A taste of the Orient.</h2>
    <p>Teriyaki is a cooking technique used in Japanese cuisine in which foods are broiled or grilled with a glaze of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar.
    </p>
    <p>The word teriyaki derives from the noun <em>teri</em>, which refers to a shine or luster given by the sugar content in the tare and <em>yaki</em>, which refers to the cooking method of grilling or broiling. Traditionally the meat is dipped in or brushed with sauce several times during cooking. Teriyaki was invented by Japanese chefs in the 1600s.
    </p>
    <p>The tare is traditionally made by mixing and heating soy sauce, sake (or mirin), and sugar (or honey). The sauce is boiled and reduced to the desired thickness, then used to marinate meat, which is then grilled or broiled. </p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a large rimmed baking sheet (cover with foil and then grease for easier clean-up). Preheat oven to 400ËšF.
        </li>
        <li>Combine uncooked sauce ingredients in a bowl and stir until the brown sugar is dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>Place individual salmon slices in a mixing bowl. Pour the sauce over the salmon, cover with plastic wrap and let marinate 20 minutes (at room temp or refrigerated).
        </li>
        <li>Transfer salmon to prepared baking sheet (keep the marinade). Bake at 400 for 12-16 min or until salmon is flaky and cooked through, bake times may vary by thickness of salmon.
        </li>
        <li>While salmon is baking, transfer remaining marinade to a small sauce pan and bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened like a syrup(3-4 min) then remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Once salmon is out of the oven, brush with teriyaki syrup, then sprinkle with chopped green onion and sesame seeds as desired.
        </li>
