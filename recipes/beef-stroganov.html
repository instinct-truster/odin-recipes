    <h2>What is Russian Beef Stroganov?</h2>
    <p>Stroganov is a simple and comforting Russian dish consisting of sauteed pieces of beef served in a sour cream sauce.</p>
    <p>It dates back to the mid-19th century and is named for a member of the Stroganov family, who were a group of highly successful Russian merchants and landowners: the richest businessmen in Tsarist Russia.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>2 Tbsp salted butter, divided</li>
        <li>8 oz button mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 lb sirloin steak, sliced thinly, against the grain</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large package of dry twisted egg noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat 1 Tbsp of butter. Saute the mushrooms in the butter over medium high heat for 2 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside. 
        </li>
        <li>Add the remaining 1 Tbsp butter to the pan and heat until melted. Add the onions to the butter and saute for 1-2 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>Toss the beef chunks with the flour and add them to the saute pan. Cook until browned, 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the beef broth, mustard powder, and tomato paste to the saute pan along with the cooked mushrooms, scraping the bottom of the pan to pick up any stuck bits.
        </li>
        <li>Simmer the mixture over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, until the beef is cooked to your liking.
        </li>
        <li>Place the sour cream into a small bowl and mix a little of the broth from the skillet with the sour cream to warm it. Pour the warmed sour cream mixture into the saucepan and mix to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Taste the stroganov and add the salt and pepper, to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Serve the stroganov on top of cooked twisted egg noodles.
